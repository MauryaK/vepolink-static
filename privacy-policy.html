                    <h5>3.3 Member due diligence</h5>
                    <p>Pursuant to our obligations under certain money laundering regulations applicable in India, we

                    <h5>3.5 Use of our Space</h5>
                    <p>We process Personal Information about your use of our Space, including location data for example,

                        recordings may be accessed by Vepolink and may be shared with competent authorities or other
                        interested third parties in accordance with applicable laws. The recordings are retained for a
                        limited period of time, but may be kept longer for the investigation of an incident or when
                        competent authorities request us to retain them longer.</p>
                    <p>The functionality of our CCTV cameras or temperature reading devices (e.g. Infrared Thermometer)
                        may include the ability to thermally scan individuals, allowing us to identify individuals who
                        are exhibiting symptoms of fever. The purpose of thermal scanning is to identify individuals who
                        may represent higher risk of transmission of certain viruses, for example COVID-19, and we
                        reserve the right to refuse entry to any person who presents with an elevated body temperature
                        consistent with fever. This data will be stored for a limited period of time with CCTV recording

                            Information we hold about you, and further details about how your Personal Information is

                        <li><strong> Request Erasure:</strong> you can also, where appropriate, have your Personal

                        <li><strong>Object to Processing:</strong> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
                            those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes
                            you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we
                            are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes;</li>
                        <li><strong>Request the Restriction of Processing:</strong> this enables you to ask us to
                            suspend the processing of Personal Information about you, for example if you want us to
                            establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</li>
                        <li><strong> Request the Transfer:</strong> of your Personal Information to another party; and
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> if we process Personal Information on the basis
                            of your consent, you have the legal right to revoke such consent at any time. We will then
